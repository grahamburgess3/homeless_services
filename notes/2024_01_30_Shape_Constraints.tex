\begin{align*}
  \min_{\{h_{t}, s_{t}\}_{t = 1, ..., T}} & \mathbb{E} [Y(h_{t},s_{t})] = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}y_{i}(h_{t},s_{t}) \\
  & \text{s.t.} \hspace{0.2cm} \{h_{t}\}_{t=1, ..., T} \in \Omega_{H} \\
  & \hspace{0.7cm} \{s_{t}\}_{t=1, ..., T} \in \Omega_{S} \\
\end{align*}

$h_t$ is the number of housing units to be built in year $t$ 

$s_t$ is the number of shelter units to be built in year $t$ 

$T$ is the decision horizon, in years 

$Y(\cdot)$ is the random system response

$y_i$ is the observed system response at the $i$th iteration

$N$ is the simulation budget for each feasible pair of build functions $\{h_t,s_t\}_{t = 1, ..., T}$

$\Omega_H$ and $\Omega_S$ capture shape constraints on the build functions.
