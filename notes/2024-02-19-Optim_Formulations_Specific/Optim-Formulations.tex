We start off with the a general optimisation formulation detailed below (as discussed in meeting of 15th Feb 2024). This formulation minimises a deterministic objective function subject to annual baseline building constraints and a total budget constraint. \par
%
Let $T \in Z^{+}$ be a fixed horizon over which to model queue behaviour and to make building decisions. \par
%
Let vectors $\boldsymbol{h} = \{h_t \hspace{0.2cm} \forall t \in {1,...,T}\}$ and $\boldsymbol{s} = \{s_t \hspace{0.2cm} \forall t \in {1,...,T}\}$ denote annual house and shelter building rates, respectively. For simplicity we say that housing/shelter building rates are constant within each year. \par
%
Let $c_{h} = 1$ be the cost of increasing $h_t$ by one, for any $t$. \par
%
Let $c_{s}$ be the cost of increasing $s_t$ by one, for any $t$. \par
%
Let $C$ be a total budget for building housing and shelter \par
%
Let $B$ be a baseline minimum annual house/shetler building rate \par
%
Let $y(\boldsymbol{h},\boldsymbol{s})$ be a deterministic objective function, evaluated using the fluid flow model. \par
%
\begin{align*}
        & \min_{\boldsymbol{h},\boldsymbol{s}} \hspace{0.2cm} y(\boldsymbol{h},\boldsymbol{s}) \\
        & \text{ s.t. } \sum_{t=1}^{T} c_{h}h_{t} + c_{s}s_{t} \leq C \\
        & \hspace{0.82cm} h_t, s_t \geq B \hspace{0.2cm} \forall t \in \{1, ..., T\}
\end{align*}
