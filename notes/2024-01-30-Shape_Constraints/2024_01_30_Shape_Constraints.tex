\begin{align*}
  \min_{\{h(t), s(t)\}} & \mathbb{E} [Y(h,s)] = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}y_{i}(h,s) \\
  & \text{s.t.} \hspace{0.2cm} h(t) = \{h_{t}\}_{t=1, ..., T} \in \Omega_{H} \\
  & \hspace{0.7cm} s(t) = \{s_{t}\}_{t=1, ..., T} \in \Omega_{S} \\
\end{align*}

\begin{itemize}
  \item $h(t)$ and $s(t)$ are build functions for housing and shelter, respectively. 
  \item $h_t$ is the number of housing units to be built in year $t$ 
  \item $s_t$ is the number of shelter units to be built in year $t$
  \item $y_i(h,s)$ is a functional whose output is the observed system response at the $i$th iteration, given build functions $h$ and $s$.     
  \item $Y(h,s)$ is a functional defining the random, unknown system response
  \item $T$ is the decision horizon, in years 
  \item $N$ is the simulation budget for each feasible pair of build functions $\{h(t),s(t)\}$
  \item $\Omega_h$ and $\Omega_s$ are sets of feasible build functions, which capture the desired shape constraints. 
\end{itemize}
