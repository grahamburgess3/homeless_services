# homeless_services
Code for PhD project on optimising homeless services

To explore this work, required packages can be installed using the following in the terminal: 

pip install -r requirements.txt

In order to run scripts which use Pyomo (as at Feb '24 this is just 'deterministic_optimisation.py', a separate conda environment (requirments detailed in conda_req.txt) should be used.
This is due to problems encountered when installing solvers for Pyomo using pip. 
Scripts not using Pyomo may not necessarily be run using this environment.
